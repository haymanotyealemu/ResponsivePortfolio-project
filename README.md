# Title: Responsive Portfolio-project
## Description of the project

This project is mainly focus on how to make our website responsive when a user opens it on different screen sizes such as xs, sm, md, lg screens with out losing or stacking the elements one to another. So, to achieve this I used a bootstrap grid system and frameworks.
The grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size. So, first I define the overall container and following the rows which is act as a wrapper to our responsive columns. The container used in this project is one of the bootstrap 4 containers which provides fixed width container rather than container-fluid class the one enables us spanning the entire width of the viewport

This portfolio website consists of navigation bar, the main content, and a sticky footer. When we look the navigation bar it has links and logo or brand. Each links named About, portfolio and contact page. Based on this I used my About page as index html page and connect with both portfolio and contact pages.

In this project I try to exercise bootstrap component and utilities section to meet the website how it should be looks like. Some of the classes from bootstrap 4 documentation applied in this project includes but not limited to navbar, card, card body, lightbox, form-group. The navigation bar is also done using bootstrap framework and for extra small devises the nav bar links used a toggler button approach.

Finally, the challenging part of this project I faced was that the portfolio page which has a group of images with text displayed as a gallery. But since the images has different sizes and difficult to make them responsive even though I used to search different materials to make it. In addition the aim of the project is also working with bootstrap frame work and minimizing the insertion of a CSS in to the our code, makes my portfolio page somehow not look good.
